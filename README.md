# PK Industries-Website
Half fake brand webpage and half personal websitge and blog, welcome to PK Industries. Here you can read all about me, my projects, and my little anecdotes I thought I'd share 

# What is PK Industries
PK Industries is a fake company I use to brand all my projects. This website is both to learn web development, and give a place to share my projects, guides, and blogs

Version 1 of this site is now deployed. I probably wont add more content, but instead focus on making it feel better, and optimize for mobile screens

This was my first time ever using html, css, and second time using JS. I tried to create a good site, and im looking for feedback.
All art and derivations of the PK Industries logo were created by me, the PK Industries logo was created with Logo.com and edited by me.
