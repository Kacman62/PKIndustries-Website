<h2>
    What is it?
</h2>

<p>
    Starting out as a MIDI controller and evolving into a standalone synth, the Moonbeam Digital Synthesizer aims to push the limits of microcontroller sound capabilities
</p>

<h2>
  Some backstory now
</h2>

<p>
  After browsing the Hack Club slack, (really go check them out they're great) I saw a new hardware program released,
  Blueprint. Similar to previous events this one provides funding for hardware projects of different levels of complexity. 
  After just finishing the design for the Cyber Watch32 (you can check that out here) I was burned out on brain power and 
  wanted to follow a guide for my next project. I had always wanted to do some kind of audio project and conveniently there was 
  a guide for a MIDI keyboard. After doing a lot of research though, I realized that MIDI controllers need an external software, 
  often called a Digital Audio Workstation or DAW to work. I imagined a more complete all in one station to create music, add effects
  and maybe even loop. What I wanted was a synthesizer
</p>

<h2>
  The plan
</h2>

<p>
  All good projects start with a good plan. I did a ton of research on lots of different ways to make sound. I had previously pulled a speaker 
  out of an old DVD player and I had a pack of buttons to act as piano keys for now. As always, however, software became my weakness.
  There are a couple of ways to make sound, but the general idea is that you send analog data, either PWM or true analog, out of an IO 
  and conect it to a speaker or amplifier. The faster the oscillations of that wave, the higher the pitch. This is where "A = 440Hz" comes from, 
  a wave going back and forth 440 times per second creates an "A" note. There are also a few audio libraries to abstract this away and make life a lot easier.
  I found a few online examples using the Mozzi audio library and even got sound to come through, albeit very faintly, but after hours of reasearch 
  I was unable to find a single project that made a standalone synthesizer using the Mozzi library. (Though there is a pretty good one using an Arduino and
  manually playing sin waves)
</p>

<h2>
  The prototype
</h2>

<p>
  Through a lot of sketchy arduino code I got different notes to play when one of 12 buttons were pressed. I then added 3 slide potentiometers, an 128px OLED 
  and rotary encoders and put all of it on a breadboard.
